        <h1>History of France</h1>
        <p id="hello">
          The first written records for the history of France appeared in the
          Iron Age. What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to
          the Romans as Gaul. Greek writers noted the presence of three main
          ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, Aquitani and Belgae.
          Over the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and Carthaginians
          established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and offshore islands.
          The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul in the late 2nd century BC,
          and legions under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the
          Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC. A Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was
          increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire. In the later stages of
          the empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration. The
          Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul in the late 5th century.
          Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The
          medieval Kingdom of France emerged from the western part of
          Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved
          increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet, founded in
          987. A succession crisis in 1328 led to the Hundred Years' War between
          the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The war began in
          1337 following Philip VI's attempt to seize the Duchy of Aquitaine
          from its hereditary holder, Edward III of England, the Plantagenet
          claimant to the French throne. A notable figure of the war was Joan of
          Arc, a French peasant girl who led forces against the English,
          establishing herself as a national heroine. The war ended with a
          Valois victory in 1453, strengthening French nationalism and
          increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the
          Ancien Régime over the next centuries, France transformed into a
          centralized absolute monarchy through the Renaissance and Reformation.
          At the height of the French Wars of Religion, France became embroiled
          in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king, Henry III,
          fought against factions the House of Bourbon and House of Guise.
          Henry, the Bourbon King of Navarre, won and established the Bourbon
          dynasty. A burgeoning worldwide colonial empire was established in the
          16th century. In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated
          institutions were overthrown in the French Revolution. The
          Revolutionary Tribunal executed political opponents by guillotine,
          instituting the Reign of Terror (1793–94). The country was governed as
          a Republic, until Napoleon's French Empire was declared in 1804.
          Following his defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, France went through
          regime changes, being ruled as a monarchy, then Second Republic, then
          Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was
          established in 1870. France was one of the Triple Entente powers in
          World War I against the Central Powers. France was one of the Allied
          Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany in 1940. The
          Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled
          directly by Germany, while the south was controlled until 1942 by the
          collaborationist Vichy government. Following liberation in 1944, the
          Fourth Republic was established. France slowly recovered, and enjoyed
          a baby boom that reversed its low fertility rate. Long wars in
          Indochina and Algeria drained French resources and ended in political
          defeat. In the wake of the 1958 Algerian Crisis, Charles de Gaulle set
          up the French Fifth Republic. Into the 1960s most of the French
          colonial empire became independent, while smaller parts were
          incorporated into the French state as overseas departments and
          collectivities. Since World War II France has been a permanent member
          in the UN Security Council and NATO. It played a central role in the
          unification process after 1945 that led to the European Union. It
          remains a strong economic, cultural, military and political factor in
          the 21st century.
